# Copilot for program development
This section is part of the repository Program Development Copilot (https://github.com/fsi-hack4autism/program-development-copilot), hosted as a part of FSI Hackathon for Autism (https://github.com/fsi-hack4autism).

* Focus is on using a copilot to generate a treatment plan
  * This module will specifically look for markers to place the child in a cohort of other children
  * The copilot will assist through various interfaces - summary reports, chatbots, indicators to watch for, etc.

# Development best practices
* Create a subfolder under data-ingestion for your project
* Add a readme.md file to explain the overall objective of your project
* Indicate the tech stack you are using
* You can upload further artifacts if you want - such as presentations, documents, excel/csv files etc.
